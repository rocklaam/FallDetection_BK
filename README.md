# FallDetection_BK
This is our Thesis Project in DUT 2018 (Planned to be released in June 2018)

## Description of system in our version 1.0
### Project Structure
The project is a solution and combination of some smaller projects including like: Core (Image Processing and Specification), Embedded (Camera and Raspery Board and Laptop Communication), and WebServices (Transform video and push notifications)...

### Hardware Of Project
In our 1*st* version, the system includes: <br/>
+ A camera (IP camera for future) to record video. <br/>
+ A Raspery board to be trained, to store a trained model, and receive video from camera to detect human's fall.<br/>
+ A laptop supports for Raspery to trained the model, and be a back up plan to control the camera, in case we do not have enough time to learn and use the Raspery Board.
